;existing file will never be overwritten.
;  "Overwrite": Always save to file named "RegionName.oar", even if we
;have to overwrite an existing file.
; AutoBackupDir: String. Default: "." (the current directory). A directory
;(absolute or relative) where backups should be saved. If the path is not a
;directory, or insufficient permissions are available, a warning will be
;printed to the console and no backups will be taken.
; AutoBackupDilationThreshold: float. Default: 0.5. Lower bound on time
;dilation required for BusyCheck heuristics to pass.  If the time dilation
